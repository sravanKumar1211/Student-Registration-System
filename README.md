 How I Made the Student Registration System Project
________________________________________
 1. Planning the Project
Before starting the code, I planned the basic flow:
â€¢	A form to collect student details.
â€¢	A way to store those details ( localStorage).
â€¢	A display table to show the registered students.
â€¢	Options to delete students.
â€¢	Basic page navigation between Registration and Student Data.
________________________________________
2. Setting Up the HTML Structure
â€¢	I created three HTML pages:
o	index.html â€“ Home page
o	Registration.html â€“ For adding student info
o	studentData.html â€“ To view all registered students
Each page used clean HTML5 structure and included Tailwind CSS via CDN for quick styling.
________________________________________
3. Adding Tailwind CSS for Responsiveness
â€¢	Used Tailwind CSS utility classes to make all elements responsive 
â€¢	Buttons, forms, and tables were styled with Tailwind for consistency and responsiveness across devices.
________________________________________
4. Creating the Registration Form
â€¢	The form included inputs for:
o	Name, Email, Contact, Student ID, Address
â€¢	Assigned unique ids and class names to each input.
â€¢	Added  validation using JavaScript .
________________________________________
5. Writing JavaScript for Functionality
â€¢	On form submission:
o	Collected values using document.getElementById()
o	Created a student object
o	Pushed it to an array of students
o	Stored the array in localStorage using JSON.stringify()
â€¢	Used localStorage.getItem() and JSON.parse() to retrieve and display saved data.
________________________________________
 6. Displaying Students in a Table
â€¢	On studentData.html, I used:
o	window.onload to load all students from localStorage
o	Dynamically created table rows with student data using innerHTML
o	A delete button for each row
________________________________________
7. Delete Functionality
â€¢	Each row had a delete button that:
o	Removed the row from the DOM
o	Filtered out the student from the array
o	Updated localStorage with the new list
________________________________________
ðŸ”¹ 8. Navigation Between Pages
â€¢	Used addEventListener on buttons like "Back to Home" or "Register" to navigate between pages using window.location.href.
________________________________________
ðŸ”¹ 9. Edit Functionality
â€¢	Each row had a edit button that:
o	Edit the row in LocalStorage
